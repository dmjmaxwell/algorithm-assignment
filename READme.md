Initialize three variables: length (to track the number of characters in the sentence), wordCount (to count the number of words), and vowelCount (to count the number of vowels).
Ask the user to input a sentence that ends with a period.
Iterate over each character in the sentence:
Increment the length variable by 1 for each character.
Check if the character is a space (' '):
If it is, increment the wordCount variable by 1.
Check if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u):
If it is, increment the vowelCount variable by 1.
After the loop ends, increment the wordCount variable by 1 to account for the last word.
Print the values of length, wordCount, and vowelCount.
